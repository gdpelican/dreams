# TODO:
# Write an initializer which populates a default Event and Organization if one
# does not exist in the database. This will allow us to be backwards compatible
# with existing instances.

# Steps:
# Check to see if there are any events / organizations in the database

# If there are no events, create one based on the following ENV variables:
# - INITIAL_EVENT_NAME
# - INITIAL_EVENT_STARTS_AT (this should be an ISO-formatted date string)
# - INITIAL_EVENT_ENDS_AT (this should be an ISO-formatted date string)

# We'll want to pull the 'submission_deadline' and 'safety_deadline'
# from the existing 'lockdown.yml' file.

# Assign all existing camps and grants to the newly created event

# If there are no organizations, create one based on the following ENV variables:
# - INITIAL_ORGANIZATION_NAME

# Assign all existing events to the newly created organization
# Assign all admin users to the newly created organization, by creating memberships for them
